[00:14.81]We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
[00:21.58]And this is our place, we make the rules
[00:27.60]And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you dear
[00:35.75]Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?
[00:41.85]Can I go where you go?
[00:48.85]Can we always be this close forever and ever?
[00:55.55]And ah, take me out, and take me home
[01:02.98]You're my, my, my, my
[01:09.12]Lover
[01:12.19]
[01:17.92]We could let our friends crash in the living room
[01:25.03]This is our place, we make the call
[01:30.88]And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
[01:37.73]I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all
[01:45.00]Can I go where you go?
[01:51.92]Can we always be this close forever and ever?
[01:58.63]And ah, take me out, and take me home (forever and ever)
[02:05.98]You're my, my, my, my
[02:12.27]Lover
[02:13.35]Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
[02:16.70]With every guitar string scar on my hand
[02:20.23]I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
[02:26.87]My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
[02:30.47]All's well that ends well to end up with you
[02:34.05]Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
[02:41.03]And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
[02:47.15]And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover
[02:55.14]Can I go where you go?
[03:01.70]Can we always be this close forever and ever?
[03:09.16]And ah, take me out, and take me home (forever and ever)
[03:16.17]You're my, my, my, my
[03:22.31]Oh, you're my, my, my, my
[03:29.38]Darling, you're my, my, my, my
[03:36.35]Lover
[03:37.30]
