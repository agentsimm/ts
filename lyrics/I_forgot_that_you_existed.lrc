[00:10.69]How many days did I spend
[00:12.34]Thinkin' 'bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong?
[00:15.75]Lived in the shade you were throwin'
[00:17.51]'Til all of my sunshine was gone, gone, gone
[00:20.91]And I couldn't get away from ya
[00:23.45]In my feelings more than Drake, so yeah
[00:25.66]Your name on my lips, tongue tied
[00:28.05]Free rent, livin' in my mind
[00:30.47]But then something happened one magical night
[00:34.43]I forgot that you existed
[00:38.80]And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
[00:44.69]And it was so nice
[00:49.56]So peaceful and quiet
[00:54.49]I forgot that you existed
[00:59.03]It isn't love, it isn't hate
[01:00.16]It's just indifference
[01:04.71]I forgot that you
[01:06.35]Got out some popcorn
[01:07.49]As soon as my rep starting going down, down, down
[01:11.38]Laughed on the schoolyard
[01:12.39]As soon as I tripped up and hit the ground, ground, ground
[01:16.41]And I would've stuck around for ya
[01:19.17]Would've fought the whole town, so yeah
[01:21.21]Would've been right there, front row
[01:23.49]Even if nobody came to your show
[01:26.00]But you showed who you are, then one magical night
[01:31.16]I forgot that you existed
[01:35.70]And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
[01:41.62]And it was so nice
[01:46.54]So peaceful and quiet
[01:51.33]I forgot that you existed
[01:55.78]It isn't love, it isn't hate
[01:57.18]It's just indifference
[02:01.59]I forgot that you
[02:02.73]Sent me a clear message
[02:05.13]Taught me some hard lessons
[02:07.64]I just forget what they were
[02:11.04]It's all just a blur
[02:14.19]I forgot that you existed
[02:18.60]And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
[02:24.39]And it was so nice
[02:29.55]So peaceful and quiet
[02:34.46]I forgot that you existed
[02:37.22]I did, I did, I did
[02:39.48]It isn't hate, it's just indifference
[02:43.63]It isn't love, it isn't hate
[02:45.03]It's just indifference (so yeah)
