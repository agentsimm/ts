[00:20.65]Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
[00:23.81]Flashbacks waking me up
[00:25.99]I get drunk but it's not enough 'cause
[00:28.06]The morning comes and
[00:29.38]You're not my baby
[00:31.19]I look through the windows of this love
[00:34.04]Even though we boarded them up
[00:36.24]Chandelier's still flickering here
[00:38.17]'Cause I can't pretend it's ok when it's not
[00:44.74]It's death by a thousand cuts
[00:52.14]I dress to kill my time
[00:54.66]I take the long way home
[00:57.22]I ask the traffic lights if it'll be all right
[00:59.74]They say 'I don't know'
[01:02.42]And what once was ours
[01:04.94]Is no one's now
[01:07.38]I see you everywhere
[01:08.65]The only thing we share
[01:10.05]Is this small town
[01:12.13]You said it was a great love
[01:14.96]One for the ages
[01:16.98]If the story's over
[01:18.89]Why am I still writing pages
[01:21.89]Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
[01:25.11]Flashbacks waking me up
[01:27.23]I get drunk but it's not enough 'cause
[01:29.40]The morning comes and
[01:30.65]You're not my baby
[01:32.49]I look through the windows of this love
[01:35.33]Even though we boarded them up
[01:37.53]Chandelier's still flickering here
[01:39.46]'Cause I can't pretend it's ok when it's not
[01:45.96]It's death by a thousand cuts
[01:52.97]My heart my hips my body my love
[01:55.76]Trying to find a part of me that you didn't touch
[01:58.26]Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
[02:00.57]Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club
[02:03.09]Our songs our films
[02:04.31]United we stand
[02:05.65]Our country
[02:06.59]Guess it was a lawless land
[02:08.56]Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
[02:11.07]Paper cut stings from our paper thin plans
[02:13.39]My time my wine my spirit my trust
[02:16.11]Trying to find a part of me you didn't take up
[02:18.67]Gave you too much but it wasn't enough
[02:21.06]But I'll be all right
[02:22.18]It's just a thousand cuts
[02:28.46]I get drunk but it's not enough 'cause
[02:31.98]You're not my baby
[02:33.84]I look through the windows of this love
[02:36.60]Even though we boarded them up
[02:38.81]Chandelier's still flickering here
[02:40.67]'Cause I can't pretend it's ok when it's not
[02:44.64]No it's not
[02:47.31]It's death by a thousand cuts
[02:51.89]Trying to find a part of me that you didn't touch
[02:55.44]My body my love
[03:00.48]But it wasn't enough it wasn't enough no no
[03:07.37]I take the long way home
[03:09.98]I ask the traffic lights if it'll be all right
[03:12.50]They say 'I don't know'
