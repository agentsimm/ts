[00:00.00]I would be complex
[00:02.28]I would be cool
[00:04.37]They'd say I played the ﬁeld before I found someone to commit to
[00:08.78]And that would be ok
[00:10.94]For me to do
[00:13.28]Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you
[00:18.52]I'd be a fearless leader
[00:20.95]I'd be an alpha type
[00:22.96]When everyone believes ya
[00:25.71]What's that like?
[00:26.65]I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
[00:30.95]Wondering if I'd get there quicker
[00:33.23]If I was a man
[00:35.38]And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
[00:39.44]'Cause if I was a man
[00:41.79]Then I'd be the man
[00:43.62]I'd be the man
[00:48.14]I'd be the man
[00:52.68]They'd say I hustled
[00:54.65]Put in the work
[00:56.83]They wouldn't shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve
[01:01.23]What I was wearing
[01:03.58]If I was rude
[01:05.46]Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves?
[01:10.85]And they would toast to me, oh
[01:13.47]Let the players play
[01:15.52]I'd be just like Leo
[01:17.91]In Saint-Tropez
[01:19.21]I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
[01:23.84]Wondering if I'd get there quicker
[01:25.66]If I was a man
[01:27.82]And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
[01:31.52]'Cause if I was a man
[01:34.13]Then I'd be the man
[01:35.91]I'd be the man
[01:40.57]I'd be the man
[01:44.02]What's it like to brag about
[01:45.53]Raking in dollars
[01:46.83]And getting bitches and models
[01:48.98]And it's all good if you're bad
[01:51.05]And it's okay if you're mad
[01:53.39]If I was out ﬂashing my dollars
[01:55.54]I'd be a bitch, not a baller
[01:57.69]They paint me out to be bad
[01:59.87]So it's okay that I'm mad
[02:03.18]I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
[02:07.58]Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (you know that)
[02:11.50]And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (coming at me again)
[02:15.63]'Cause if I was a man (if I was a man)
[02:17.97]Then I'd be the man (then I'd be the man)
[02:20.47]I'm so sick of running as fast as I can (as fast as I can)
[02:24.86]Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (hey)
[02:29.01]And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (coming at me again)
[02:33.14]'Cause if I was a man (if I was a man), then I'd be the man
[02:37.22]I'd be the man
[02:41.37]I'd be the man (oh)
[02:45.71]I'd be the man (yeah)
[02:50.35]I'd be the man (I'd be the man)
[02:54.11]
[02:57.58]If I was a man
[03:00.93]Then I'd be the man
[03:03.12]
