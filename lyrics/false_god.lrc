[00:06.38]We were crazy to think
[00:08.49]Crazy to think that this could work
[00:10.20]Remember how I said I'd die for you?
[00:14.80]
[00:18.23]We were stupid to jump
[00:20.66]In the ocean separating us
[00:22.46]Remember how I'd fly to you?
[00:26.76]
[00:29.29]And I can't talk to you when you're like this
[00:32.72]Staring out the window like I'm not your favorite town
[00:35.98]I'm New York City
[00:38.48]I still do it for you, babe
[00:41.26]They all warned us about times like this
[00:44.43]They say the road gets hard and you get lost when you're led by blind faith
[00:50.03]Blind faith
[00:53.54]But we might just get away with it
[00:57.77]Religion's in your lips
[01:00.85]Even if it's a false god
[01:04.79]We'd still worship
[01:05.99]We might just get away with it
[01:09.74]The altar is my hips
[01:12.86]Even if it's a false god
[01:16.60]We'd still worship this love
[01:19.88]We'd still worship this love
[01:22.78]We'd still worship this love
[01:27.71]
[01:30.21]I know heaven's a thing
[01:32.77]I go there when you touch me
[01:34.40]Honey hell is when I fight with you
[01:38.91]
[01:42.35]But we can patch it up good
[01:44.64]Make confessions and we're begging for forgiveness
[01:47.05]Got the wine for you
[01:53.17]And you can't talk to me when I'm like this
[01:56.97]Daring you to leave me just so I can try and scare you
[01:59.94]You're the West Village
[02:02.57]You still do it for me, babe
[02:05.17]They all warned us about times like this
[02:08.48]They say the road gets hard and you get lost when you're led by blind faith
[02:14.24]Blind faith
[02:17.63]But we might just get away with it
[02:21.78]Religion's in your lips
[02:24.96]Even if it's a false god
[02:28.72]We'd still worship
[02:30.07]We might just get away with it
[02:33.72]The altar is my hips
[02:36.87]Even if it's a false god
[02:40.70]We'd still worship this love
[02:43.77]We'd still worship this love
[02:46.63]We'd still worship this love, ah
[02:52.86]Still worship this love
[02:55.66]Even if it's a false god
[02:58.61]Even if it's a false god
[03:01.99]Still worship this love
[03:06.03]
