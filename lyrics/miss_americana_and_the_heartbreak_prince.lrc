[00:10.230]
[00:12.020]You know I adore you,
[00:14.070]I'm crazier for you
[00:15.760]Than I was at sixteen,
[00:17.640]Lost in a film scene
[00:19.140]Waving homecoming queens,
[00:20.710]Marching band playing
[00:22.170]I'm lost in the lights
[00:24.500]
[00:25.170]American glory faded before me
[00:28.490]Now I'm feeling hopeless,
[00:30.010]Ripped up my prom dress
[00:31.560]Running through rose thorns,
[00:33.130]I saw the scoreboard
[00:34.640]And ran for my life (Ah, ah, ah)
[00:38.800]
[00:39.580]No cameras catch
[00:41.110]My pageant smile
[00:42.610]I counted days,
[00:44.140]I counted miles
[00:45.650]To see you there,
[00:47.190]To see you there
[00:49.180]It's been a long time coming, but
[00:50.780]
[00:51.710]It's you and me,
[00:53.170]That's my whole world
[00:54.910]They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl" (Okay)
[00:58.210]The whole school is rolling fake dice
[01:01.100]You play stupid games,
[01:02.430]You win stupid prizes
[01:04.140]
[01:04.750]It's you and me,
[01:05.990]There's nothing like this
[01:07.590]Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
[01:10.980]We're so sad, we paint the town blue
[01:14.010]Voted most likely to run away with you
[01:18.080]
[01:19.220]My team is losing,
[01:21.210]Battered and bruising
[01:22.830]I see the high fives
[01:24.420]Between the bad guys
[01:26.080]Leave with my head hung,
[01:27.630]You are the only one
[01:29.250]Who seems to care
[01:31.700]
[01:32.460]American stories
[01:33.950]Burning before me
[01:35.500]I'm feeling helpless,
[01:37.100]The damsels are depressed
[01:38.780]Boys will be boys then,
[01:40.570]Where are the wise men?
[01:42.040]Darling, I'm scared (Ah, ah, ah)
[01:45.230]
[01:46.490]No cameras catch
[01:48.060]My muffled cries
[01:49.850]I counted days,
[01:51.370]I counted miles
[01:52.800]To see you there,
[01:54.410]To see you there
[01:56.170]And now the storm is coming, but
[01:58.570]
[01:59.010]It's you and me,
[02:00.510]That's my whole world
[02:02.020]They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl" (Okay)
[02:05.510]The whole school is rolling fake dice
[02:08.140]You play stupid games,
[02:09.600]You win stupid prizes
[02:11.080]
[02:12.030]It's you and me,
[02:13.130]There's nothing like this
[02:14.770]Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
[02:17.950]We're so sad, we paint the town blue
[02:20.900]Voted most likely to run away with you
[02:24.820]
[02:29.570]And I don't want you to (Go),
[02:31.220]I don't really wanna (Fight)
[02:32.850]'Cause nobody's gonna (Win),
[02:34.470]I think you should come home
[02:36.030]And I don't want you to (Go),
[02:37.660]I don't really wanna (Fight)
[02:39.290]'Cause nobody's gonna (Win),

[02:42.060]
[02:42.690]And I don't want you to (Go),
[02:44.100]I don't really wanna (Fight)
[02:45.620]'Cause nobody's gonna (Win),
[02:47.160]I just thought you should know
[02:49.010]And I'll never let you (Go)
[02:50.490]'Cause I know this is a (Fight)
[02:51.990]That someday we're gonna (Win)
[02:55.580]
[02:56.680]It's you and me,
[02:58.160]That's my whole world
[02:59.710]They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl"
[03:04.560]Oh, I just thought you should know
[03:08.230](You should know)
[03:09.360]
[03:09.890]It's you and me,
[03:10.780]There's nothing like this (Like this)
[03:12.370]Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
[03:15.600]We're so sad, we paint the town blue (Paint it blue)
[03:18.790]Voted most likely to run away with you
[03:20.070]
[03:21.040]And I don't want you to (Go),
[03:22.420]I don't really wanna (Fight)

[03:36.920]That's my whole world
[03:38.600]They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl"
