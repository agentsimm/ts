[00:03.90]The moon is high
[00:05.30]Like your friends were the night that we first met
[00:07.70]Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet
[00:10.00]Now I've read all of the books beside your bed
[00:13.50]The wine is cold
[00:14.70]Like the shoulder that I gave you in the street
[00:16.90]Cat and mouse for a month or two or three
[00:19.20]Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe
[00:24.10]Kiss me once 'cause you know I had a long night (Oh)
[00:26.10]Kiss me twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)
[00:28.40]Three times 'cause I waited my whole life (1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4)
[00:32.70]I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
[00:37.20]Uh huh, that's right
[00:39.40]Darling, you're the one I want, and
[00:42.10]I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
[00:46.40]Uh huh, that's right
[00:48.60]Darling, you're the one I want
[00:51.00]In paper rings in picture frames in dirty dreams
[00:57.90]Oh, you're the one I want
[01:00.30]In the winter, in the icy outdoor pool
[01:02.80]When you jumped in first, I went in too
[01:05.40]I'm with you even if it makes me blue
[01:08.90]Which takes me back
[01:10.00]To the color that we painted your brother's wall
[01:12.30]Honey, without all the exes, fights, and flaws
[01:14.60]We wouldn't be standing here so tall, so
[01:18.70]Kiss you once 'cause I know you had a long night (Oh)
[01:21.50]Kiss you twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)
[01:23.80]Three times 'cause you waited your whole life (1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4)
[01:28.40]I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
[01:32.60]Uh huh, that's right

[01:46.60]In paper rings in picture frames in dirty dreams
[01:53.20]Oh, you're the one I want
[01:55.70]I want to drive away with you
[01:58.50]I want your complications too
[02:00.80]I want your dreary Mondays
[02:02.90]Wrap your arms around me, baby boy
[02:05.40]I want to drive away with you
[02:07.70]I want your complications too
[02:10.00]I want your dreary Mondays
[02:12.10]Wrap your arms around me, baby boy
[02:23.80]I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings

[03:00.20]In paper rings in picture frames in all my dreams
