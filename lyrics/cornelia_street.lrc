[00:07.600]We were in the backseat
[00:10.110]Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
[00:16.140]
[00:17.790]"I rent a place on Cornelia Street"
[00:21.550]I say casually in the car
[00:26.720]
[00:27.250]We were a fresh page on the desk
[00:31.010]Filling in the blanks as we go
[00:36.410]
[00:37.040]As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
[00:40.530]Leading us home
[00:44.750]
[00:45.400]
[00:45.990]And I hope I never lose you
[00:48.390]Hope it never ends
[00:50.680]I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
[00:55.150]
[00:55.610]That's the kinda heartbreak
[00:57.930]Time could never mend
[00:59.920]I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
[01:04.230]
[01:04.730]And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
[01:14.250]And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
[01:20.810]
[01:21.820]I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
[01:26.440]I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
[01:30.250]
[01:31.020]
[01:32.560]Windows flung right open, autumn air
[01:36.180]Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours
[01:41.690]
[01:42.400]We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
[01:45.540]Memorize the creaks in the floor
[01:50.680]
[01:51.460]Back when we were card sharks, playing games
[01:54.950]I thought you were leading me on
[02:00.530]
[02:01.200]I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
[02:04.290]Before you even knew I was gone
[02:08.140]
[02:09.020]
[02:10.540]But then you called, showed your hand
[02:12.300]I turned around before I hit the tunnel
[02:14.670]Sat on the roof, you and I
[02:17.980]
[02:18.590]
[02:18.970]I hope I never lose you
[02:21.470]Hope it never ends
[02:23.710]I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
[02:28.130]
[02:28.770]That's the kinda heartbreak
[02:30.940]Time could never mend
[02:33.150]I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
[02:37.450]
[02:38.400]And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
[02:47.670]And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
[02:54.410]
[02:55.160]I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
[02:59.710]I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
[03:04.490]
[03:05.440]
[03:06.330]You hold my hand on the street
[03:08.930]Walk me back to that apartment
[03:11.200]Years ago, we were just inside
[03:14.540]
[03:15.380]Barefoot in the kitchen
[03:17.800]Sacred new beginnings
[03:20.180]That became my religion, listen
[03:23.770]
[03:24.330]
[03:24.770]I hope I never lose you
[03:29.210]I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
[03:36.970]Oh, never again
[03:43.350]
[03:44.750]And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
[03:54.190]And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
[04:01.550]
[04:02.360]I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
[04:07.050]I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
[04:10.950]
[04:12.000]
[04:12.910]I don't wanna lose you (Hope it never ends)
[04:15.550]I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
[04:17.370]I don't wanna lose you (Yeah)
[04:20.170]
[04:21.320]
[04:22.330]"I rent a place on Cornelia Street"
[04:25.410]I say casually in the car
[04:28.420]
