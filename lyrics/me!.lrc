[00:00.00] I promise that you'll never find another like me  
[00:06.00] I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh  
[00:09.00] I know I never think before I jump  
[00:12.00] And you're the kind of guy the ladies want  
[00:15.00] (And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)  
[00:18.00] I know that I went psycho on the phone  
[00:21.00] I never leave well enough alone  
[00:24.00] And trouble's gonna follow where I go  
[00:27.00] (And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)  

[00:30.00] But one of these things is not like the others  
[00:33.00] Like a rainbow with all of the colors  
[00:36.00] Baby doll, when it comes to a lover  
[00:39.00] I promise that you'll never find another like  

[00:42.00] Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[01:06.00] I know I tend to make it about me  
[01:09.00] I know you never get just what you see  
[01:12.00] But I will never bore you, baby  
[01:15.00] (And there's a lot of lame guys out there)  
[01:18.00] And when we had that fight out in the rain  
[01:21.00] You ran after me and called my name  
[01:24.00] I never wanna see you walk away  
[01:27.00] (And there's a lot of lame guys out there)  

[01:30.00] 'Cause one of these things is not like the others  
[01:33.00] Livin' in winter, I am your summer  
[01:36.00] Baby doll, when it comes to a lover  
[01:39.00] I promise that you'll never find another like

[02:09.00] Girl, there ain't no I in "team"  
[02:12.00] But you know there is a "me"  
[02:15.00] Strike the band up, one, two, three  
[02:18.00] I promise that you'll never find another like me  

[02:21.00] Girl, there ain't no I in "team"  
[02:24.00] But you know there is a "me"

[03:12.00] Girl, there ain't no I in "team"  
[03:15.00] (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)  
[03:18.00] But you know there is a "me"  
[03:21.00] I'm the only one of me
