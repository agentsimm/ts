[00:03.58]Combat, I'm ready for combat
[00:10.00]I say I don't want that, but what if I do?
[00:18.78]'Cause cruelty wins in the movies
[00:25.95]I've got a hundred thrown-out speeches I almost said to you
[00:34.23]Easy they come, easy they go
[00:37.89]I jump from the train, I ride off alone
[00:41.65]I never grew up, it's getting so old
[00:45.55]Help me hold onto you
[00:48.81]I've been the archer
[00:52.35]I've been the prey
[00:56.50]Who could ever leave me, darling?
[01:00.17]But who could stay?
[01:05.02]Dark side, I search for your dark side
[01:11.67]But what if I'm alright, right, right, right here?
[01:20.10]And I cut off my nose just to spite my face
[01:26.76]Then I hate my reflection for years and years
[01:35.32]I wake in the night, I pace like a ghost
[01:39.26]The room is on fire, invisible smoke
[01:43.05]And all of my heroes die all alone
[01:47.09]Help me hold onto you
[01:50.10]I've been the archer,
[01:53.86]I've been the prey
[01:57.27]Screaming, who could ever leave me, darling?
[02:01.53]But who could stay?
[02:02.69](I see right through me, I see right through me)
[02:06.09]'Cause they see right through me
[02:08.49]They see right through me
[02:10.25]They see right through
[02:11.65]Can you see right through me?
[02:13.91]They see right through
[02:15.69]They see right through me
[02:17.70]I see right through me
[02:19.83]I see right through me
[02:21.72]All the king's horses, all the king's men
[02:25.37]Couldn't put me together again
[02:29.07]'Cause all of my enemies started out friends
[02:33.00]Help me hold onto you
[02:36.23]I've been the archer
[02:39.78]I've been the prey
[02:43.83]Who could ever leave me, darling?
[02:47.59]But who could stay?
[02:50.70](I see right through me, I see right through me)
[02:51.48]Who could stay?
[02:55.52]Who could stay?
[02:59.31]Who could stay?
[03:03.22]You could stay
[03:06.87]You could stay
[03:10.88]You
[03:15.68]Combat, I'm ready for combat
