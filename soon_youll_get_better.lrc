[00:10.40]The ******* of my coat were tangled in my hair
[00:14.90]In doctor's office lighting, I didn't tell you I was scared
[00:21.10]
[00:21.90]That was the first time we were there
[00:24.30]Holy orange bottles, each night, I pray to you
[00:28.60]Desperate people find faith, so now I pray to Jesus too
[00:34.70]
[00:35.40]And I say to you...
[00:38.20]
[00:39.60]Soon, you'll get better
[00:42.40]
[00:44.20]Soon, you'll get better
[00:46.50]
[00:48.90]You'll get better soon
[00:52.90]
[00:53.90]'Cause you have to
[00:56.50]
[01:05.70]I know delusion when I see it in the mirror
[01:10.20]You like the nicer nurses, you make the best of a bad deal
[01:15.70]
[01:17.20]I just pretend it isn't real
[01:19.60]I'll paint the kitchen neon, I'll brighten up the sky
[01:23.90]I know I'll never get it, there's not a day that I won't try
[01:29.90]
[01:31.10]And I say to you...
[01:33.10]
[01:34.80]Soon, you'll get better
[01:37.60]
[01:39.60]Soon, you'll get better
[01:42.20]
[01:44.10]You'll get better soon
[01:47.60]
[01:49.60]'Cause you have to
[01:51.90]
[01:52.70]And I hate to make this all about me
[01:56.90]
[01:58.50]But who am I supposed to talk to?
[02:02.00]
[02:02.90]What am I supposed to do
[02:06.00]
[02:08.60]If there's no you?
[02:11.60]
[02:12.40]This won't go back to normal, if it ever was
[02:17.10]It's been years of hoping, and I keep saying it because
[02:23.90]'Cause I have to
[02:26.20]
[02:28.40]You'll get better
[02:31.30]
[02:32.70]Soon, you'll get better
[02:35.10]
[02:37.50]You'll get better soon
[02:40.90]
[02:46.50]Soon, you'll get better
[02:49.30]
[02:51.10]Soon, you'll get better
[02:53.90]
[02:56.00]You'll get better soon
[02:59.50]
[03:01.30]'Cause you have to
