[00:11.43]You are somebody that I don't know
[00:13.93]But you're takin' shots at me like it's Patr√≥n
[00:16.44]And I'm just like, damn, it's 7 AM
[00:22.68]Say it in the street, that's a knock-out
[00:25.22]But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out
[00:27.53]And I'm just like, "Hey, are you okay?"
[00:32.79]
[00:34.11]And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
[00:36.30]But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
[00:42.60]And snakes and stones never broke my bones
[00:45.08]
[00:45.67]So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
[00:50.26]You need to calm down, you're being too loud
[00:56.10]And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (oh)
[01:01.61]You need to just stop
[01:04.49]Like can you just not step on my gown?
[01:07.24]You need to calm down
[01:12.38]
[01:13.68]You are somebody that we don't know
[01:15.98]But you're comin' at my friends like a missile
[01:18.19]Why are you mad?
[01:21.23]When you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)
[01:24.79]Sunshine on the street at the parade
[01:27.63]But you would rather be in the dark age
[01:29.74]Just makin' that sign must've taken all night
[01:35.31]
[01:36.13]You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
[01:38.96]And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
[01:44.43]'Cause shade never made anybody less gay
[01:46.93]
[01:47.47]So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
[01:52.17]You need to calm down, you're being too loud
[01:57.97]And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (oh)
[02:03.40]You need to just stop
[02:06.38]Like can you just not step on his gown?
[02:09.19]You need to calm down
[02:10.12]
[02:10.67]And we see you over there on the internet
[02:13.36]Comparing all the girls who are killing it
[02:16.01]But we figured you out
[02:17.70]We all know now we all got crowns
[02:20.51]You need to calm down
[02:21.56]
[02:22.00]Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
[02:26.13]You need to calm down (you need to calm down)
[02:28.93]You're being too loud (you're being too loud)
[02:31.75]And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (oh)
[02:37.40]You need to just stop (can you stop?)
[02:40.15]Like can you just not step on our gowns?
[02:43.05]You need to calm down
[02:45.67]
