[00:03.48](Ah, you know, just 'round London)
[00:06.51]
[00:09.81]I love my hometown
[00:11.47]As much as Motown, I love SoCal
[00:15.60]And you know I love Springsteen
[00:17.75]Faded blue jeans, Tennessee whiskey
[00:21.94]But something happened, I heard him laughing
[00:25.15]I saw the dimples ﬁrst and then I heard the accent
[00:28.07]They say home is where the heart is
[00:31.67]But that's not where mine lives
[00:33.74]You know I love a London boy
[00:36.07]I enjoy walking Camden Market in the afternoon
[00:40.17]He likes my American smile
[00:41.98]Like a child when our eyes meet
[00:43.83]Darling, I fancy you
[00:46.23]Took me back to Highgate
[00:47.78]Met all of his best mates
[00:49.16]So I guess all the rumors are true

[01:13.73]Show me a grey sky, a rainy cab ride
[01:16.96]Babes, don't threaten me with a good time
[01:19.76]They say home is where the heart is
[01:23.21]But God, I love the English
[01:25.69]You know I love a London boy
[01:27.93]I enjoy nights in Brixton, Shoreditch in the afternoon
