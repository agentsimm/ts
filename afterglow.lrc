[00:04.83]I blew things out of proportion
[00:06.52]Now you're blue
[00:09.07]Put you in jail for something you didn't do
[00:13.19]I pinned your hands behind your back, oh
[00:17.30]Thought I had reason to attack, but no
[00:21.81]Fighting with a true love
[00:23.42]Is boxing with no gloves
[00:26.12]Chemistry 'til it blows up, 'til there's no us
[00:30.10]Why'd I have to break what I love so much?
[00:34.49]It's on your face
[00:36.66]And I'm to blame
[00:37.76]I need to say
[00:39.04]Hey, it's all me, in my head
[00:45.51]I'm the one who burned us down
[00:48.97]But it's not what I meant
[00:54.01]Sorry that I hurt you
[00:56.22]I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you
[01:00.44]I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you
[01:03.74]I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go
[01:11.41]Meet me in the afterglow
[01:15.96]It's so excruciating to see you low
[01:20.28]Just wanna lift you up and not let you go
[01:24.63]This ultraviolet morning light below
[01:28.96]Tells me this love is worth the ﬁght, oh
[01:33.05]I lived like an island
[01:35.39]Punished you with silence
[01:37.42]Went off like sirens, just crying
[01:41.56]Why'd I have to break what I love so much
[01:45.87]It's on your face
[01:47.95]Don't walk away, I need to say
[01:50.26]Hey, it's all me, in my head
[01:56.60]I'm the one who burned us down
[02:00.37]But it's not what I meant
[02:05.03]I'm sorry that I hurt you
[02:07.70]I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you
[02:11.97]I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you
[02:15.05]I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go
[02:22.52]Meet me in the afterglow
[02:25.21]Tell me that you're still mine
[02:27.26]Tell me that we'll be just ﬁne
[02:29.51]Even when I lose my mind
[02:32.18]I need to say
[02:33.51]Tell me that it's not my fault
[02:35.76]Tell me that I'm all you want
[02:38.19]Even when I break your heart
[02:41.19]I need to say
[02:42.37]Hey, it's all me, in my head
[02:48.60]I'm the one who burned us down
[02:52.23]But it's not what I meant
[02:57.31]Sorry that I hurt you
[02:59.71]I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you
[03:03.78]I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you
[03:07.10]I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go
[03:14.25]Meet me in the afterglow
[03:16.21]
